## Rob's Daily Tasks
### Scaffold a day

```sh
# example: `cargo scaffold 1`
git checkout -b day<day>
cargo scaffold <day>
cargo download <day>
```

update unit tests w/ sample outputs.
Every [solution](https://github.com/fspoettel/advent-of-code-rust/blob/main/src/bin/scaffold.rs#L11-L41) has _unit tests_ referencing its _example_ file. Use these unit tests to develop and debug your solution against the example input. For some puzzles, it might be easier to forgo the example file and hardcode inputs into the tests.

When editing a solution, `rust-analyzer` will display buttons for running / debugging unit tests above the unit test blocks.

### Run solutions for a day

```sh
# example: `cargo solve 01`
cargo solve <day>

# output:
#     Running `target/debug/01`
# 🎄 Part 1 🎄
#
# 6 (elapsed: 37.03µs)
#
# 🎄 Part 2 🎄
#
# 9 (elapsed: 33.18µs)
```

`solve` is an alias for `cargo run --bin`. To run an optimized version for benchmarking, append the `--release` flag.

Displayed _timings_ show the raw execution time of your solution without overhead (e.g. file reads).

### Run all solutions

```sh
cargo all

# output:
#     Running `target/release/advent_of_code`
# ----------
# | Day 01 |
# ----------
# 🎄 Part 1 🎄
#
# 0 (elapsed: 170.00µs)
#
# 🎄 Part 2 🎄
#
# 0 (elapsed: 30.00µs)
# <...other days...>
# Total: 0.20ms
```

`all` is an alias for `cargo run`. To run an optimized version for benchmarking, use the `--release` flag.

_Total timing_ is computed from individual solution _timings_ and excludes as much overhead as possible.

### Run all solutions against the example input

```sh
cargo test
```

### Format code

```sh
cargo fmt
```

### Lint code

```sh
cargo clippy
```
